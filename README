This plugin expands code snippets for which the trigger is a regular
expression; submatches can be reused in the expansion. Along with command
substitution, regular expressions allow the user to define flexible snippets.

A few examples:

- In HTML, expand "<mytag" to
    <mytag>$$</mytag>
(with $$ marking the next position of the cursor), no matter what
"mytag" is.

- In Ruby, expand "do" to
    do
      $$
    end
and "do a b c" to
    do |a, b, c|
      $$
    end
with a single pattern.

- In JavaScript, expand "var a b c" to
    var a = $$,
        b = $$,
        c = $$;

- Etc.

The plugin follows a minimalist design, trying to be a simple yet powerful
tool, using Vim's native resources (vim script, search patterns), and avoiding
fancy features.
